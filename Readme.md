Instability has many faces: random crashes, sporadic data corruption, flaky tests and others. They are hard to reproduce and fix. 
And they might be a cause why people burn-out or get fired. See  [Johnny's story](http://drugalya.com/johnny-the-automator/)

Each instability is an undetected wrong assumption, which survives a testing and can an even sneak into a public release. 

I believe that if an incorrect assumption survived someone’s critical thinking, there is a chance that others made the same mistake.
 Therefore I decided to start this project, where I’ll be sharing such incorrect assumptions and encourage you to the same. 

Imagine, you spent days of debugging, found a real source of instability and shared it. Someone reads your finding and claims 
“Shit, I might have the same issue in my code base!” It is a plus to karma. 

Whether it is a text description or code, or both, it should be simple. Any programming languages are welcome.

And one final thing. Often, dumbest instabilities are hiding under the umbrella of complexity. When distilled, 
it might feel shameful that something like this was a part of your code base. Please share it anyway. 
You can still explain why it was hard to discover and if there is a way how others might find it.
