# Project description

`Instabilities.ProcessOutputConsumer` is a console program, which starts  `Instabilities.ProcessOutputProducer` and pass it an argument, saying how many lines ProcessOutputProducer must produce.
When read messages `ProcessOutputConsumer` accumulates them in a string queue.

# Wrong assumption

`ProcessOutputConsumer` will process all the messages produced by `ProcessOutputProducer`, so `actualMessageCount` is equal to a requested message count.

# Why it is wrong

Very simple. `queue` is a subject of race condition. 


```
p.OutputDataReceived += (sender, eventArgs) =>
{
    if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(eventArgs.Data))
    {
        processOutout.Enqueue(eventArgs.Data);
    }
};
```

`OutputDataReceived` is not invoked in the main thread and therefor there is a race condition on a `processOutout` object.

Possible outcomes:

1. Everything is OK.

```
Lines read: 100 Expected: 100
Lines read: 1000 Expected: 1000
Lines read: 10000 Expected: 10000
Press any key to continue . . .
```

2. Some messages are missed


```
Lines read: 100 Expected: 100
Lines read: 1000 Expected: 1000
Lines read: 9999 Expected: 10000
Press any key to continue
```

3. "Done" message is missed

If this case `ProcessOutputConsumer` will hang.


4. Queue throws an exception

Depending on the framework version, exception might vary in my case it was 
 
```
Unhandled Exception: System.ArgumentException: Source array was not long enough. Check srcIndex and length, and the array's lower bounds.

```

Looks like queue re-allocation blown up.


# Some obesravations

- Longer Thread.Sleep value is, less likely it is to get outcome #4 and more likely it is to get #1
- Adding `Trace.WriteLine(msg)` into message reading loop will also increase chances for #1


# How it was detected

Project I've discovered it was working this way. Consumer process was reading and output of Producer process.
Consumer was expecting some control messages. Rarely these control messages didn't arrive. It didn't show up to often and therefore was not causing a significant pain. Until one day logging traffic increased.
We found `Producer's` logs, saved on disk, contained missed control messages, which made us start look what could be wrong in a Consumer's code. 

We build a stress test which stresses the same set classes as production code.  In a couple of iteration we distilled it into this project example.

# Why it survided

- One of the unit tests for involved classed detected shown this problem. 
- It is easy to assume that `p.OutputDataReceived` is invoked in the same thread. I still see `Console.WriteLine` inside this callback. This could produce a data race on `System.Console` if main tread still executes.
- `p.OutputDataReceived` was too hidden

# How to find it in your codebase

- Search for `OutputDataReceived` and `ErrorDataReceived` and check what is invoked inside
- If your log system can do it, log thread id's for all the messages you processing.Alternatively you hook Console.System.Out and also log thread ids for each message. 

# How to fix
- synchronize access to queue or use one of the existing thread-safe queues
- get rid of shared data
